# Bash Harmonic Function Analyzer

A Bash script that identifies the harmonic function of specific musical chords across various Major and Minor Keys.

## 🎵 Overview

This tool helps musicians and theorists understand how a single chord functions in different musical contexts. Input a chord (e.g., "C", "Fm", "G#", "Bbm"), and the script scans through a database of Major and Minor keys to output every key where that chord appears, along with its Roman Numeral degree (I, ii, IV, V, etc.).
