# 🎲 Bash Chord Progression Generator

A Bash script that simulates a dice roll to generate random 4-chord progressions based on a specific musical key.

## 🎵 Overview

This tool is designed to spark creativity for musicians, composers, and improvisers. By inputting a musical key (e.g., "C", "Am", "F#"), the script simulates rolling a 6-sided die four times. Each roll selects a diatonic chord from that key, creating a unique harmonic progression to use as a foundation for your next song or practice session.
